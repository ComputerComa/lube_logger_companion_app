# lube_logger_companion_app

A Cross Platfrom (Android & IOS primarily) companion app for the Open Source [Lube Logger](https://github.com/hargata/lubelog) vehicle maintenance and fuel Mileage Tracker. 


## Getting Started
This companion app requires a Lube Logger instance setup already. If you don't have this setup, read here on instructions on how to get it setup. [Getting Started](https://docs.lubelogger.com/Installation/Getting%20Started) 

You will need to have your instance publicly available (Don't forget password Protection!) or have some sort of remote access to your instance (tailscale, wireguard, etc. )

This app is very much still in development so expect new features, breaking changes, etc. 
The ultimate goal is to be as close as possible in similarity as the Web App. This may not be possible in all instances.
